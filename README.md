Introduction

Welcome to Synthuxpad, a web based synth interface interface designer powered by React and using Three.js & three-fiber for rendering.


Goals

We intend to add the following functions to the alpha:
- Custom board sizing, material, color (basic function complete)
- Custom lighting (basic function complete)
- Custom camera view (not started)
- Parts Catalog (a few real parts added, some still just placeholders)
- Add, Remove, Clear, Edit for any part in the catalog (partially done, no graphics)
- Parametric constraints (collision control, edge distance, snap to grid alignment)


Development Plan

This is a WIP prototype. We have settled on a basic UI design and are coding the building blocks. We are working out the basic functionality with dynamic Formik menus. Once we have all alpha functionality with menu control, we will connect inputs to to graphics/mouse interaction.
